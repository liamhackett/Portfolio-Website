        <h1>My Spotify Visualization Project</h1>
        <p>As the lead developer on the Spotify Visualization project, I have been responsible for overseeing the development of an innovative display system using Raspberry Pi and LED Matrix technology. Our goal is to create a unique way of visualizing the music being played on Spotify, allowing users to see the album covers and other information about the currently playing song in real-time.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, we worked with the Spotify API to retrieve data about the song being played, including the album cover image. Using the LED matrix's library, we were been able to display these images in a dynamic and visually appealing way. In order to make this process as seamless as possible, I created a Python script that retrieves the data from the Spotify API and sends it to the LED matrix, allowing users to enjoy a vibrant and engaging visual display while listening to their favorite music. I am proud to have been a part of this exciting project, which has challenged me to think creatively and utilize hardware to bring our vision to life.</p>
